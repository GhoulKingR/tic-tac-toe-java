# Introduction

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game! This project was created as an introduction to GUI programming in Java using the Swing library. The game allows two players to play against each other, either on the same computer.

To get started with the project, you will need to have the following software installed on your computer:

* Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
* An integrated development environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA

Once you have these tools installed, you can download the source code for the project and open it in your IDE. From there, you can build and run the game.

I hope you have fun playing the game!
